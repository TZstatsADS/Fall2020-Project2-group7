# Project 2: COVID-19 AS WE KNOW IT!

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app about COVID-19 topic using NYC Health open data released on the [NYC Coronavirus Disease 2019 Data](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- study legacy codes and further development
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: This project is titled COVID-19 as we know it because it is a play on words for Life as we know it. Our life has been turned upside down because of COVID. So many important and life changing events have occured, odd facts about COVID have been spread and, our usual spots have been up rooted. This app provides the users with a timeline of all the events that have unfolded from Feb. 29th 2020 to Sep. 30th, 2020. It also helps to disprove the Presidents theory about temperature and its relationship to COVID cases. Lastly, this app helps users find a new and safe handgout spot/restaurent.
